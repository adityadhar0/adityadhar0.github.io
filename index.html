<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

<h3>I am a first year PhD student in finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</h3>
<br>

I am interested in political economy, international finance, and macro-finance. Before coming to Chicago, I received an A.B. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard College ('22) and worked at Bain & Company as a management consultant. You can find my CV <a href= assets/docs/CV.pdf>here</a>.

Previously, I debated for Harvard. I now coach the <a href='https://www.speechanddebate.org/usa-debate/'> USA Debate Team.</a>
