<h1> Welcome! </h1> 

<h3>I am a second year Ph.D. student in the <a href='https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/financial-economics-joint-program'>Joint Program in Financial Economics</a> at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics.</h3>
<br>

I am interested in political economy, international finance, and macro-finance. Before coming to Chicago, I received an A.B. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard College ('22) and worked at Bain & Company as a management consultant. You can find my CV <a href= assets/docs/CV.pdf>here</a>.

Previously, I debated for Harvard. I now coach the <a href='https://www.speechanddebate.org/usa-debate/'> USA Debate Team.</a>
